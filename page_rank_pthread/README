To compile and execute the serial and parallel page-rank implementations two scripts have been provided. 


-- SERIAL PAGE RANK COMPUTATION

To run the serial version, "serial_runScript" needs to be executed as following:
./serial_runScript.sh 200K-graph.txt

-- Here instead of the 200K-graph.txt, any other input graph can also be passed. The output will be present in the file "pagerank.result".



-- PARALLEL PAGE RANK COMPUTATION

To run the parallel version, "parallel_runScript" needs to be executed as following:
./parallel_runScript.sh <input-graph>

Example:
./parallel_runScript.sh 4M-graph.txt 

-- Here:	input-graph 		--> 200K-graph.txt

-- Instead of these arguments any other arguments can also be placed.


NOTE:
-- All the "time" are outputted in "nanoseconds (ns)".
-- To search for the timing part, please look for "gettimeofday()"
-- results are available in "pagerank.result"
